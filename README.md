# The-Verdant-Grove

## About
The Verdant Grove is an e-commerce website selling fruits built to showcase a user-friendly shopping journey. This project simulates a fully functional fruit store, complete with:

- AI-Generated Images: All fruits and hybrid fruits (both real and imagined) are brought to life using the power of artificial intelligence.
- Comprehensive User Flow: Users can create accounts, log in, search for items, add products to their carts, manage checkout selections, proceed through payment simulations, update profile information, and view order history.
- Frontend Focus: This initial version prioritizes the frontend experience, ensuring a smooth and intuitive shopping simulation for desktop users in full-screen mode. Responsive design for a wider range of devices is actively being developed.

## Tools Used:
- Vite
- Typescript
- React router
- SCSS

## Features to come:
- Backend integration
- Responsive design for all devices

### Notes:
- This is fully frontend and also does not use localStorage to store data, thus on page refresh, website will be resetted.
